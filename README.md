# image_splicing_forgery_detection
Developed a method that uses CNN-based transfer learning and Error Level Analysis (ELA) to detect picture splicing
forgeries.
– InceptionV3, ResNet50, and a custom CNN were trained for the classification of false versus real images using the CASIA
v2.0 dataset.
– Using TensorFlow and Python, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference pipelines were implemented.
